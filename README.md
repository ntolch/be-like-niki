# Be Like Niki


## About
Here's how it works:
* Answer a few basic questions about yourself, including your name.
* Get sharable text back telling others how they can be more like you.


"...what we want from the Internet is not an exchange of unique ideas, but an echo chamber where our perceived uniqueness is undermined by the desire to have our unique ideas validated by those who feel the exact same way. To put it in Bill’s terms, if everyone is smart, and everyone is like Bill, then what’s the point of Bill in the first place?"


"As we put our own “unique” spin on the meme of the week, what is it that’s actually being advanced? Is it our own, unique ideas, or is it more fodder for the echo chamber? Is it us influencing the memes, or is it the other way around?"
